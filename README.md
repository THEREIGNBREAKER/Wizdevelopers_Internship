### Project Phase: POS System Data Analysis
After the training, I worked on the main project, which involved analyzing various aspects of POS systems. The goal was to derive meaningful insights that could help improve the performance and market understanding of POS systems. Below is a detailed explanation of the different tasks and analyses conducted during the project:

- **Market Share of POS Companies**
  - **Objective:** To understand the competitive landscape of POS systems in India by identifying the market share of different companies.
  - **Method:** Collected data on various POS companies, their market presence, and analyzed the distribution using pie charts and bar graphs.

- **Annual Revenue of POS Companies**
  - **Objective:** To analyze the financial performance of POS companies by examining their annual revenue.
  - **Method:** Aggregated revenue data, created visualizations to compare the earnings of different companies, and identified trends and patterns.

- **Number of Installations by Company**
  - **Objective:** To determine the adoption rate of different POS systems by examining the number of installations.
  - **Method:** Compiled installation data, used bar charts to visualize the number of installations by each company, and analyzed the data to understand market penetration.

- **Distribution of Pricing Models**
  - **Objective:** To explore the different pricing strategies employed by POS companies.
  - **Method:** Collected information on pricing models (e.g., subscription-based, one-time purchase), and created visualizations to show the prevalence of each model.

- **Key Features of POS Systems**
  - **Objective:** To identify the key features offered by various POS systems and their importance to users.
  - **Method:** Analyzed feature data, created visualizations to highlight the most commonly offered features, and correlated them with user preferences and market demand.

- **Regions with Highest Usage**
  - **Objective:** To find out which regions in India have the highest usage of POS systems.
  - **Method:** Geographically segmented the installation data, created maps and heatmaps to visualize regional usage, and identified key areas for market expansion.

- **Correlation Matrix**
  - **Objective:** To understand the relationships between different variables in the dataset, such as revenue, market share, number of installations, and key features.
  - **Method:** Created a correlation matrix to visualize and analyze the relationships, helping to identify significant correlations and insights.
